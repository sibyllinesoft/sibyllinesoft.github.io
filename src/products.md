# Products

Our products provide a cutting edge developer experience and AI capabilities while slashing your SaaS bill and giving you total control over your software.

If you're leading a team that has to hit revenue targets, AI can't be another science experiment. You need systems that land in your repos, enforce process, and give stakeholders proof that shipping speed is compounding—not just another slide in a board update.

Sibylline builds the boring-but-critical scaffolding: opinionated infrastructure, evaluators, and orchestration that arrive production-ready. Agents plug into the workflows you already run, wrap themselves in governance, and hand you dashboards that explain why velocity just spiked.

Every product on this page is designed to be snap-fit. Start with one pillar to unblock your biggest bottleneck, then layer in the rest when you're ready. The stack grows with you—from the IC automating diffs at 2am to the Fortune 500 platform team reining in inference spend.

**What You Get on Day Zero**
* **Zero-Setup Infrastructure:** Spin up governed development environments—with CI/CD, monitoring, and identity policies—in under ten minutes across any cloud or on-prem footprint.
* **Intelligent Cost Guardrails:** Routing, caching, and adaptive model selection trim 40-60% off inference bills while preserving latency guarantees your stakeholders can feel.
* **Unlimited Context Memory:** Compression, recall, and policy-aware retention keep agents focused for 300+ message sessions without you curating prompts or fighting tool limits.

## Infrastructure & Execution

Your engineers lose momentum every time they wait on infrastructure tickets or blow a sprint debugging flaky agents. This pillar eliminates both so the rest of your org sees value immediately.

    <div class="project-pitch">
      <p><strong>When one agent isn't enough.</strong></p>
      <p>Complex problems need specialized expertise from multiple angles. MIMIR coordinates research agents—code analysis, literature review, cross-domain synthesis—into a six-stage intelligence pipeline that tackles what single agents miss.</p>
