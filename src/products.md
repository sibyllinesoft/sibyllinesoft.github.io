## Sibylline: AI Tools for Autonomous, Efficient Development

Production-ready AI tools that eliminate setup friction and scale automatically. Teams report 40-80% productivity gains through intelligent automation that works from day one.

**Core Value:**
* **Zero-Setup Infrastructure:** Deploy complete development environments in minutes, not weeks
* **Intelligent Cost Optimization:** AI routing reduces inference costs by 40-60% automatically  
* **Unlimited Context Management:** Never lose development momentum to conversation restarts

## Infrastructure & Execution

Teams lose weeks to infrastructure setup and unpredictable AI costs. Zero-setup environments and intelligent cost optimization that scales automatically.
