   <p><strong>Vibe coding starts out great.</strong> You tell your agent to do things, and you come back ten minutes later to working software. Fast forward 50,000 lines of code and you have a labrynthian codebase that agents struggle with, full of duplications and architectural drift. You want to ship new features but every change your agents make breaks something else, so you're putting out fires instead of delivering. Your velocity has slowed to a crawl and your customers are getting restless. <strong>The vibes have faded and you're left cleaning up after an AI rager.</strong></p>
      <p>You might try to solve this by going over agent pull requests with a fine toothed comb and doing manual refactoring passes, but now your velocity is dragging and your competitors are lapping you on features. <strong>The answer to fading vibes isn't to give up your speed, but to improve your process.</strong></p>
   <p>I know what you're thinking, why not just burn some GPU cycles getting agents to clean up the codebase? You might have gotten an agent to successfully refactor a small codebase at some point, but don't let that mislead you. <strong>Agent refactoring ability doesn't scale with codebase size.</strong> Once your codebase passes a threshold, they get lost when trying to refactor it just like they do when trying to create new code.</p>

                  <p>I found myself making mental notes about potential improvements everywhere but had no way to prioritize them. Should I fix the missing documentation first? The unused variables?

   <p>Fear not though, there's a solution to keep the good vibes rolling: give your agents a map. That's where Valknut comes in.<strong> Valknut gives agents a step by step plan they can follow to make your code cleaner, more organized and maintainable.</strong> No random walks through code space, no futile cycling, no nit picking, just a clear path to improved code quality.</p>
   
   <p>Under the hood, Valknut is a performance monster built on cutting-edge algorithms. We're talking SIMD-accelerated mathematical processing delivering 2-4x performance gains, Bayesian statistical normalization for robust analysis across challenging codebases, and LSH-based duplicate detection with sub-linear similarity search. <strong>Valknut analyzes 100k+ files in under 30 seconds while using less than 2GB of memory.</strong> Most tools choke on large codebases; Valknut laughs.</p>
   
   <p>Speed means nothing if the output is garbage though. Valknut is best in class here as well. It combines graph-based dependency analysis with centrality metrics (betweenness, eigenvector, PageRank-style importance), quantifies technical debt ratios with ROI-driven prioritization, and groups related problems into Impact Packs for systematic refactoring. <strong>This isn't your father's linter—it's a next-generation analysis engine that bridges traditional static analysis with modern AI-powered development workflows.</strong></p>

   <p><strong>Valknut goes beyond refactoring to help agents quickly find and test un-covered code.</strong> Standard coverage reports are hard for agents to read and act upon. Valknut groups uncovered code into blocks and provides agents with clear code pointers they can use to accurately identify untested code from coverage report data.</p>
