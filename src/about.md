    <h2>Two Decades of AI Innovation</h2>
    <div class="about-pitch">
      <p><strong>The Journey:</strong> My fascination with machine learning began during the Netflix Prize in 2007—a pivotal moment that sparked a lifelong passion for extracting insights from data. Since then, I've dedicated myself to understanding how intelligent systems can amplify human capabilities and create new possibilities.</p>
      
      <p><strong>The Experience:</strong> Over the years, I've built a reputation for designing and building powerful data-driven applications that help entrepreneurs and growing companies unlock their potential. My sweet spot? Helping startups figure out how to leverage their data to build amazing apps, and increasingly, how to harness AI to enable entirely new types of programs.</p>

      <p class="about-philosophy"><strong>My Philosophy:</strong> The best AI systems don't replace human intelligence—they amplify it.
