   <p><strong>AI development starts out magical.</strong> You feed your agents a few key files, and they understand your codebase instantly. Fast forward to a 100k+ line repository and your agents are drowning in noise, unable to distinguish critical architecture from boilerplate. They hallucinate relationships that don't exist and miss the ones that do. Your AI-assisted development has slowed to a crawl as agents waste cycles parsing irrelevant files. <strong>The magic has faded and you're left with confused AI that can't see the forest for the trees.</strong></p>
      <p>You might try manually curating file lists or writing custom selection scripts, but now you're spending more time managing context than building features. Your competitors are shipping faster because their AI actually understands their codebase structure. <strong>The answer to AI confusion isn't to give up on automation, but to give your AI the intelligence it needs.</strong></p>
   <p>I know what you're thinking—why not just throw everything at the AI and let it figure it out? You might have succeeded with small projects, but don't let that mislead you. <strong>AI understanding doesn't scale with raw file count.</strong> Once your repository passes a threshold, agents get overwhelmed trying to parse everything, just like humans do when dropped into an unfamiliar large codebase.</p>

            <p><strong>Your AI is burning tokens on noise.</strong> Without intelligent file selection, AI tools treat a package.json the same as your core business logic.

                  <p>I spent equal time analyzing generated migration files, node_modules dependencies, and build artifacts as I did on the core business logic. The result was a shallow understanding of everything and deep insight into nothing. I couldn't identify the key patterns because I was drowning in peripheral details.</p>

   <p>The solution isn't more context—it's smarter context. That's where Scribe comes in. <strong>Scribe transforms your repository into intelligent, AI-ready bundles that preserve what matters while filtering out the noise.</strong> No more random file selection, no more missing dependencies, no more drowning in irrelevant details—just precise, contextual understanding.</p>
   
   <p>Under the hood, Scribe is an analysis powerhouse built with cutting-edge algorithms. We're talking multi-language AST parsing, PageRank-based dependency analysis for import graph centrality, and sophisticated heuristic scoring that identifies truly important files. <strong>Scribe analyzes 100k+ files in seconds while building complete dependency maps and intelligent file rankings.</strong> Most tools just list files; Scribe understands relationships.</p>
   
   <p>Speed means nothing if the output lacks intelligence though. Scribe excels here with multi-dimensional scoring that weighs documentation importance, import centrality, git churn signals, template detection, and entrypoint analysis. It groups related files into coherent bundles and provides interactive editing for fine-tuning selection. <strong>This isn't your typical file listing tool—it's a next-generation repository intelligence engine that bridges traditional static analysis with modern AI-powered workflows.</strong></p>

   <p><strong>Scribe goes beyond simple file selection to create contextually rich, dependency-aware bundles.</strong> Standard repository tools just concatenate files. Scribe provides structured metadata, import relationship maps, and intelligent file scoring that helps AI understand not just what files exist, but how they relate and which ones matter most.</p>
